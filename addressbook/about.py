DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    A simple stand-alone address book for keeping track
    of people's addresses, contact information, identification,
    and relationships.

WHY?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    I created this address book because I was frustrated with
    current address book solutions which try to integrate
    everything.  The current software-industry ( or projects )
    trend towards pushing users personal information into the
    cloud is alarming, not so-much about where the data is
    stored but how badly data is leaked, hacked, and compelled
    ( by law enforcement ) for data access. Additionally,
    cloud services have let me down by corrupting my data,
    failing to secure my data, and the worse offense of all;
    deleting my data when I needed it most.

    Perhaps, more simply-put, I wanted an address book that
    no-one may control but me, is simple, and cloudless.
    After all clouds mean rain and I've had enough of it.

YOUR DATA
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    The software data, your data, is captured via data entry fields
    and stored in a SQlite database saved in the directory where
    you installed this application. This application has no data
    security features and anyone with access to the directory
    where the database is installed may read your data.

    Your data is your responsibility and you are solely responsible
    for what happens to it.  Back-up your data to a safe and secure
    location. Take care to secure your data against
    unauthorized access.
